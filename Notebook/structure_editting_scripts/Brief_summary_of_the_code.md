Modification Step Explanation:

    Initial Structure: You start with the initial DNA structure.
    Identify Point for Removal: In each iteration, you identify a valid point in the DNA structure where a strand can be removed.
    Remove Strand: You remove one strand from the structure that is closest to the identified point.
    Simulate: You then simulate the modified DNA structure to determine its new properties, such as the bend angle.
    Measure Bend Angle: You measure the bend angle of the modified structure.
    Record Results: The bend angle is recorded, and the process repeats with the next strand removal.

    Each cycle through these steps represents a single "modification step".

Main Workflow Breakdown:

    Here's how the main workflow in your script corresponds to the modification steps:

        Initialization:
            Load the initial DNA structure.
            Initialize variables to keep track of results and excluded strands.

        Modification Loop:
            Identify Point: Find a valid point in the DNA structure for strand removal.
            Remove Strand: Remove the strand closest to the identified point, ensuring it’s not the longest strand and hasn’t already been removed.
            Simulate: Export the modified structure and run the simulation.
            Measure Bend Angle: Measure the bend angle of the simulated structure.
            Record Results: Store the bend angle and the point where the measurement was taken.
            Check Termination: If the bend angle is within the desired tolerance, stop the loop.

Plot Explanation:

    The plot will show how the bend angle changes with each successive strand removal (modification step). Here’s what to expect:

    X-axis (Modification Step): Represents each iteration of the strand removal process. The first point (0) is the initial structure, and each subsequent number (1, 2, 3, ...) represents a step where one more strand has been removed.
    Y-axis (Bend Angle): Represents the measured bend angle in degrees after each modification step.
